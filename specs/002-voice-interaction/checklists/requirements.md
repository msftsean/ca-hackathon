# Specification Quality Checklist: Voice Interaction

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before planning
**Created**: 2026-03-13
**Feature**: [specs/002-voice-interaction/spec.md](../spec.md)
**Constitution**: v1.1.0

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) — ✅ Spec references Azure OpenAI Realtime API and WebRTC as product-level constraints, not implementation choices
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs — ✅ All user stories describe student outcomes
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders — ✅ Problem statement and vision are accessible
- [x] All mandatory sections completed — ✅ Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria all present

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain — ✅ Zero markers in spec
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous — ✅ All VFR-* have clear pass/fail criteria
- [x] Success criteria are measurable — ✅ VSC-001 through VSC-006 have numeric targets
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic — ✅ Measured in user-facing terms (seconds, percentages)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined — ✅ 15 acceptance scenarios across 5 user stories
- [x] Edge cases are identified — ✅ 6 edge cases covered (language, noise, PII, length, interruption, concurrency)
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded — ✅ "Out of Scope (v1)" section with 9 explicit exclusions
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified — ✅ 6 assumptions, 4 dependencies listed

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria — ✅ 25 functional + 5 non-functional requirements
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows — ✅ P1-P5 cover core, escalation, hybrid, accessibility, degradation
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria — ✅ 6 measurable outcomes
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification — ✅ Clean

## Constitution v1.1.0 Alignment

- [x] Principle I (Bounded Authority): VFR-007/008 ensure voice routes through same pipeline
- [x] Principle II (Human Escalation): User Story 2 covers voice escalation
- [x] Principle III (Privacy): VFR-010, VNFR-005 cover PII filtering + no raw audio
- [x] Principle IV (Stateful Context): VFR-011/012 cover session sharing
- [x] Principle V (Test-First): Acceptance scenarios defined for all stories
- [x] Principle VI (Accessibility): User Story 4 + VFR-017/018 cover voice a11y
- [x] Principle VII (Degradation): User Story 5 + VFR-019/020/022 cover fallbacks
- [x] Voice Channel Security: VFR-003/024/025 cover ephemeral tokens + WS relay

## Notes

- All items pass. Spec is ready for `/speckit.clarify` and `/speckit.plan`.
- Existing spec was comprehensive — updated header for Constitution v1.1.0 alignment.
