## Scoring Guidelines

### Calculating Final Score

1. **Core Labs (00-06):** Sum points from criteria 1-7 (maximum 105 points)
2. **Stretch Goal (Lab 07):** Add points from criterion 8 (maximum 10 points)
3. **Total:** Sum of all earned points (maximum 115 points)

### Passing and Certification

| Score Range | Result |
|-------------|--------|
| 75-115 | Pass - Certificate Awarded |
| 65-74 | Near Pass - May resubmit specific labs |
| Below 65 | Not Passing - Significant work needed |

### Certificate Requirements

To receive a 47 Doors Boot Camp completion certificate, participants must:

1. **Achieve a minimum score of 75 points** from any combination of labs
2. **Complete all core labs (00-06)** with at least a "Beginning" score in each
3. **Demonstrate understanding** through verbal explanation or documentation
4. **Submit all required evidence** for assessed labs

### Handling Stretch Goal Scoring

The MCP Server (Lab 07) is designed as a stretch goal to challenge advanced participants:

- **Not required for certification:** Participants can earn a certificate with 75+ points from core labs alone
- **Bonus points:** Stretch goal points can push total score above 105
- **Maximum display score:** While mathematically possible to earn 115 points, certificates will show "115" as the maximum
- **Recognition:** Participants who complete the stretch goal receive special recognition (e.g., "With Distinction" notation)

### Special Circumstances

**Team Submissions:**
- All team members receive the same score unless individual contributions are clearly distinguishable
- Coaches may adjust individual scores if one team member clearly contributed more/less

**Partial Completion:**
- Award points based on the highest level fully achieved
- Do not average between levels
- When in doubt, award the lower level and provide specific feedback

**Technical Difficulties:**
- If a participant experienced documented technical issues beyond their control, coaches may:
  - Allow additional time
  - Accept alternative evidence
  - Adjust expectations proportionally

## Feedback Guidelines

When providing assessment feedback:

1. **Be specific:** Reference exact code, output, or behaviors observed
2. **Be constructive:** Focus on what can be improved, not just what's wrong
3. **Celebrate successes:** Acknowledge what was done well
4. **Provide next steps:** Give actionable recommendations for improvement
5. **Be encouraging:** Remember this is a learning experience
