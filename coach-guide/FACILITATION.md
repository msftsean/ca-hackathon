# 47 Doors Boot Camp Facilitation Guide

This guide provides facilitators with a structured approach to leading the 47 Doors AI Agent boot camp curriculum. The 7-hour format (9:00 AM - 4:00 PM) balances hands-on learning with sufficient pacing to accommodate diverse skill levels.

## 7-Hour Timeline (9:00 AM - 4:00 PM)

### Coach Escalation Playbook (Enterprise Azure Environments)

Use this rapid triage sequence when multiple participants are blocked by Azure access issues:

1. **Conditional Access block (`AADSTS53003`)**
   - Switch affected participants to service principal auth workflow.
2. **No subscription visibility for SP**
   - Confirm RBAC assignment at subscription or resource-group scope.
3. **`MissingSubscriptionRegistration` during `azd up`**
   - Ask subscription admin to register `Microsoft.App` and `Microsoft.Web`.
4. **Cosmos regional capacity errors**
   - Move Cosmos to an allowed region (for example `canadacentral`) and keep app hosting region unchanged.
5. **Lab continuity strategy**
   - Keep participants progressing with backend-first deployment path; static frontend deployment can be a follow-on step.

### 9:00 - 9:30 | Welcome & Lab 00: Environment Setup (30 min)

**Objectives:**

- Establish psychological safety and excitement
- Verify all participants have working development environments
- Set expectations for the day

**Facilitator Actions:**
| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 9:00-9:10 | Welcome, introductions, day overview |
| 9:10-9:15 | Distribute credentials, explain support channels |
| 9:15-9:28 | Participants complete Lab 00 setup |
| 9:28-9:30 | Quick poll: thumbs up/down on environment status |

**Pacing Markers:**

- By 9:20 (midpoint): 70% should have VS Code/Codespace open
- By 9:25: 90% should have Python environment activated
- By 9:30: 100% should show successful test run or be paired with someone who has

**If Behind:**

- Pair struggling participants with those who finished early
- Have facilitator circulate to troubleshoot top 3 issues
- Extend by 5 min max; cut intro content, not setup time

**Key Checkpoints:**

- [ ] Can run `python --version` (3.11+)
- [ ] Can run `pytest` with no errors
- [ ] Azure credentials loaded (environment variables set)

### 9:30 - 10:00 | Lab 01: Understanding Agents (30 min)

**Objectives:**

- Build mental model of AI agents vs. simple LLM calls

**Facilitator Actions:**
| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 9:30-9:40 | Present agent concepts (slides/whiteboard) |
| 9:40-9:50 | Walk through three-agent architecture diagram |
| 9:50-9:55 | Quick exercise: classify sample intents as a group |
| 9:55-10:00 | Transition to Lab 02 |

**Pacing Markers:**

- By 9:45: All participants understand QueryAgent → RouterAgent → ActionAgent flow
- By 9:55: Group has classified 5+ sample intents together
- By 10:00: Ready to move to Azure MCP setup

**If Behind:**

- At 9:45, if concepts unclear: use whiteboard to draw data flow
- Focus on understanding, not hands-on coding (exercises are take-home)
- Keep energy high - this is foundational knowledge

**Key Checkpoints:**

- [ ] Participant can explain why multi-agent > monolithic
- [ ] Participant understands the three-agent pattern
- [ ] Participant can identify intent categories

**Intervention Points:**

- Common confusion: Agent vs. prompt engineering. Clarify the loop.
- This is a conceptual lab - exercises can be completed later
- Keep discussion focused on architecture, not implementation details

---

### 10:00 - 10:30 | Lab 02: Azure MCP Setup (30 min)

**Objectives:**

- Configure Model Context Protocol connection to Azure

**Pacing Markers:**

- By 10:15 (midpoint): 60% should have Azure OpenAI connection verified
- By 10:25: 85% should have both OpenAI and Search connected
- By 10:30: 100% should be ready (or have noted issue for later)

**If Behind:**

- [ ] MCP configuration file is valid JSON

**Intervention Points:**

- Most common issue: Azure subscription permissions
- Watch for: Expired tokens or wrong region endpoints
- Escalate: Any persistent 403/401 errors to Azure admin immediately
- If Node engine errors appear for Azure MCP, move participants to Node 20 before re-running checks
- If CA blocks browser login, pivot to service principal auth immediately to preserve lab timing

---

### 10:30 - 11:15 | Lab 03: Spec-Driven Development (45 min)

**Objectives:**

| RetrieveAgent complete | 12:25 | 60%                 |

**Note:** Index is pre-created, so participants focus on search and generation only.

**If Behind:**

- At 11:55, if <70% have search working: provide search_tool.py solution
- At 12:15, if <50% have agent: do live coding demo
- Always preserve 5 min at end for quick demos

**Key Checkpoints:**

| Multi-turn tested   | 2:30 | 50%                 |

**If Behind:**

- At 1:40, if <50% have QueryAgent: provide solution snippet
- At 2:00, if <40% have RouterAgent: do live coding demo

| Tested in cloud      | 3:45 | 50%                 |

**Note:** Deployment has high variance due to Azure subscription limits and quotas.

**If Behind:**

- At 3:00, if <60% configured: distribute pre-made azd config
- At 3:25, if many waiting on provisioning: show what successful deployment looks like
- If quota errors: have backup resource group or demo deployed instance
- Celebrate ANY successful deployment loudly

**Key Checkpoints:**

- [ ] `azd env` shows correct configuration
- [ ] `azd provision` completes without errors
- [ ] `azd deploy` pushes application code
- [ ] Deployed endpoint responds to requests

**Intervention Points:**

- Most common issue: Azure quota exceeded
- Watch for: Wrong region selection causing capacity errors
- Red flag: Subscription spending limits about to be hit
- Have Plan B: Demo from facilitator's pre-deployed instance

| 3:50-3:55 | Lab 07 (stretch) introduction and resources |
| 3:55-4:00 | Feedback forms, final Q&A, thank you |

**No pacing markers needed** - this is flexible closing time.

- [ ] Every participant can articulate one thing they learned
- [ ] Stretch content links shared
- [ ] Feedback collected from >80% of participants
- [ ] Participants know how to continue learning

---

## Intervention Decision Framework

Use this framework to decide when to intervene:

### Green Zone - Productive Struggle

- Participant is engaged and making attempts
- Error messages are being read and researched
- Questions are specific and show understanding
- **Action:** Observe, encourage, let them work through it

### Yellow Zone - Consider Intervening

- Same error for 5+ minutes without progress
- Visible frustration or disengagement
- Asking very broad questions ("Why doesn't it work?")
- **Action:** Check in with open question, offer hint, pair with peer

### Red Zone - Immediate Intervention

- Technical blocker affecting multiple participants
- Participant visibly upset or shutting down
- Error that cannot be resolved without facilitator help
- 10+ minutes stuck on same issue
- **Action:** Direct assistance, provide solution, or note for post-session

### Intervention Techniques

1. **The Drive-By Check:** "How's it going? What are you working on?"
2. **The Rubber Duck:** "Talk me through what you've tried"
3. **The Breadcrumb:** "Have you looked at line 42?" (don't give answer)
4. **The Pair-Up:** "Alex just solved something similar - Alex, can you share?"
5. **The Reset:** "Let's close everything and start fresh from checkpoint X"
6. **The Demo:** "Watch me do this one, then you'll try the next"

## Contingency Plans

### If 30+ minutes behind schedule:

- Skip extension exercises in current and remaining labs
- Convert hands-on to live coding with participation
- Compress breaks (minimum 5 min for each scheduled break)
- Lab 07 becomes take-home only

### If Azure services have outage:

- Switch to local development mode (mock endpoints)
- Use cached responses for demo purposes
- Focus on code structure and patterns over working API calls
- Document issue for post-boot camp support

### If significant portion (>30%) struggling:

- Pause for group teaching moment
- Create impromptu help tables (those ahead help those behind)
- Simplify remaining exercises
- Ensure everyone completes core path even if reduced scope

### If running ahead:

- Allow more exploration time
- Add extension exercises
- Deeper Q&A sessions
- Start Lab 07 in-session

---

## Facilitator Self-Care

- Take breaks when participants take breaks
- Stay hydrated
- Don't absorb participant frustration
- Celebrate small wins (yours and theirs)
- It's okay if not everyone finishes everything

---

## Post-Event Checklist

- [ ] Collect all feedback forms
- [ ] Note any Azure resources that need cleanup
- [ ] Document common issues for curriculum improvement
- [ ] Send follow-up email with resources and Lab 07 materials
