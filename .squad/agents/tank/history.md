### 2026-03-15 — Phone Call-In Feature (ACS Call Automation)

**Architecture decisions**

- ACS Call Automation bridges inbound PSTN calls to Azure OpenAI Realtime API via WebSocket media streaming (`MediaStreamingOptions`). Audio flows: PSTN caller → ACS → WebSocket → Azure OpenAI Realtime. Backend is never in the audio path — same pattern as browser WebRTC.
- Reused the same `gpt-4o-realtime-preview` deployment and 4-tool pipeline as browser voice. PHONE_SYSTEM_PROMPT is phone-specific (terse, no markdown, no scrolling back) but same agent identity.
- `PhoneServiceInterface` added to `backend/app/services/interfaces.py` following same ABC pattern as `RealtimeServiceInterface`. `AzurePhoneService` uses lazy-init `CallAutomationClient` with async double-checked locking — same pattern as `AzureRealtimeService`.
- Mock service (`MockPhoneService`) uses SYNCHRONOUS methods (not async). This is intentional — the service tests call it without `await`. The API layer uses `_call()` helper (`inspect.isawaitable`) to handle both sync mocks and async production services. This is the correct pattern for Pydantic-v2 codebases with mixed sync/async test coverage.
- ACS webhook events use TWO different event type names for subscription validation: `Microsoft.EventGrid.SubscriptionValidationEvent` AND `Microsoft.EventGrid.SubscriptionValidated`. Both must be handled.
- Event Grid delivers callbacks as JSON arrays. Call Automation callbacks use flat dicts with `event_type` and `call_connection_id` as direct top-level keys (not wrapped in `data`). The phone API normalizes both formats.
- ACS `listKeys().primaryConnectionString` provides the connection string for the `CallAutomationClient`. Managed identity is the preferred production auth path.

**Pydantic v2 gotcha — multiple model validators**

- Pydantic v2 only supports ONE `@model_validator(mode="after")` per class. Defining a second one with a different method name OVERRIDES the first silently (with a warning). Fix: combine all after-validators into a single method (`_auto_disable_features`). This affected the voice+phone auto-disable logic in `config.py`.

**Key file paths**

- `backend/app/services/azure/phone.py` — ACS Call Automation production service
- `backend/app/services/mock/phone.py` — Synchronous mock for test isolation
- `backend/app/api/phone.py` — `/api/phone/incoming` (Event Grid) + `/api/phone/callbacks` (Call Automation) + `/api/phone/health`
- `backend/app/models/phone_schemas.py` — `IncomingCallEvent`, `CallEventRequest`, `CallState`, `PhoneHealthResponse`, `EventGridValidationEvent`
- `infra/main.bicep` — ACS resource (always provisioned, not conditional), ACS connection string secret, Contributor role assignment for backend managed identity, `AZURE_ACS_ENDPOINT` env var + output
- `backend/app/core/config.py` — `phone_enabled`, `azure_acs_endpoint`, `azure_acs_connection_string`, `acs_phone_number`, `max_call_duration`

**New SDK dependency**

- Added `azure-communication-callautomation>=1.4.0` to both `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml`



### 2026-03-13 — Voice Interaction Phase 0/1 Research & Data Model

**Architecture decisions**

- WebRTC transports audio direct browser → Azure; backend is never in the audio path (no audio storage, no codec pipeline).
- Ephemeral token endpoint `POST /api/realtime/session` issues ≤60 s TTL credentials; Azure API key stays server-side only.
- Tool calls flow over a dedicated WS relay `/api/realtime/ws/{session_id}`; voice pipeline MUST route through the same QueryAgent → RouterAgent → ActionAgent chain (Constitution I).
- Three-layer PII filter: pre-tool, post-tool, pre-speech (Constitution III).
- Mock mode: full `RealtimeService` mock implementing `RealtimeServiceInterface` — activated by existing `settings.use_mock_services`.
- Six-state UI machine: idle → connecting → listening → processing → speaking → idle (+ error from connecting/listening/processing).
- Voice and text share the same `session_id` UUID; voice transcript entries appended with `input_modality = "voice"` discriminator.
- `eastus2` primary region — only region with `gpt-4o-realtime-preview` availability matching existing infra region.

**Key file paths**

- `backend/app/models/schemas.py` — Pydantic v2 model patterns; `@field_validator` + `@classmethod`; `Optional[T]` with `default=None`
- `backend/app/models/enums.py` — `str, Enum` pattern for all enumerations
- `backend/app/services/interfaces.py` — ABC interface pattern for all service integrations (voice service will follow same structure)
- `backend/app/core/config.py` — `mock_mode` / `use_mock_services` pattern; `SettingsConfigDict` with `.env` loading
- `specs/002-voice-interaction/research.md` — Phase 0 decision log (10 decisions)
- `specs/002-voice-interaction/data-model.md` — Phase 1 entity definitions (7 backend models, 3 frontend types)

**Patterns to replicate for Phase 1 implementation**

- New voice models go in `backend/app/models/voice_schemas.py` and `backend/app/models/voice_enums.py`
- Service interface goes in `backend/app/services/interfaces.py` (extend existing file, same ABC pattern)
- Config additions go in `backend/app/core/config.py` under a new `# Voice / Realtime Settings` section
- Frontend types go in `frontend/src/types/voice.ts`

### 2026-03-14 — Phase 1 Setup (T001, T002, T003)

**Config changes (T001)**

- Added 6 voice fields to `Settings` in `backend/app/core/config.py` under a `# Voice / Realtime API Settings` section.
- Used `model_validator(mode="after")` (Pydantic v2) to auto-set `voice_enabled=False` when `azure_openai_realtime_deployment` is empty AND `mock_mode=False`. Validator confirmed working: mock_mode=True keeps voice_enabled=True, mock_mode=False with empty deployment flips it to False.
- `max_voice_session_duration` added (600 s default) as requested in the task brief; tasks.md did not list it but the spec and user instructions both required it.

**Env stubs (T002)**

- Appended 6 voice vars to `backend/.env.example` with a `# Voice / Realtime API Configuration` comment block.
- Used `gpt-4o-realtime-preview` as the deployment stub value (matches tasks.md; user task brief used `gpt-4o-realtime` — tasks.md value preferred as canonical).

**Bicep (T003)**

- Added `openAiRealtimeDeployment` resource inside the Azure OpenAI resource block in `infra/main.bicep`, model `gpt-4o-realtime-preview`, version `2025-04-01`, sku Standard, capacity 1.
- Added `dependsOn: [openAiDeployment]` to sequence deployments and avoid throttle conflicts during provisioning.
- Added output `AZURE_OPENAI_REALTIME_DEPLOYMENT` so azd wires the deployment name into app settings automatically.

### 2026-03-14 — Live Azure Deployment (azd up)

**Deployment verified and documented**

- `azd up` completed successfully. All services running live on Azure (MOCK_MODE=false).
- **Container App URL**: `https://frontdoor-6wfum6gndxawy-backend.blackflower-446b9850.eastus2.azurecontainerapps.io`
- **Resource Group**: `rg-vvoice`
- **Azure OpenAI Endpoint**: `https://frontdoor-6wfum6gndxawy-openai.openai.azure.com/`
- **OpenAI Deployments**: `gpt-4o` (text) + `gpt-4o-realtime-preview` (voice/WebRTC)
- **Cosmos DB**: `https://frontdoor-zfyhb6f72odyg-cosmos.documents.azure.com:443/`
- **AI Search**: `https://frontdoor-6wfum6gndxawy-search.search.windows.net`
- **Container Registry**: `frontdoor6wfum6gndxawyacr.azurecr.io`
- **Region**: `eastus2`
- **Subscription**: `ME-MngEnvMCAP262307-segayle-1`
- Health checks verified: `/api/health` → LLM connecting (ticketing, knowledge_base, session_store up); `/api/realtime/health` → realtime_available: true, mock_mode: false, voice_enabled: true
- Updated DEMO_RUNBOOK.md and docs/index.html: replaced all placeholder `${AZURE_CONTAINERAPP_URL}` and old resource group/subscription references with live values. Runbook is now Azure-first throughout.

### 2026-03-14 — Frontend Container App Deployment

**Architecture decisions**

- Frontend deployed as a separate Container App alongside the backend, both in the same Container App Environment.
- nginx reverse-proxies `/api/` requests to the backend, making all API calls same-origin from the browser's perspective — eliminates CORS issues entirely.
- `BACKEND_URL` is injected via env var and resolved at container startup using `envsubst` (only `${BACKEND_URL}` is substituted; nginx variables like `$host`, `$uri` are preserved).
- Dockerfile default `BACKEND_URL=http://backend:8000` preserves docker-compose backward compatibility.
- Added WebSocket upgrade headers (`Upgrade`, `Connection`) and long read timeout (86400s) to nginx `/api/` location for voice relay WebSocket support.
- Frontend Container App: 0.25 vCPU, 0.5Gi memory, 1-2 replicas — lightweight since it only serves static files + proxies.
- Backend Container App retains external ingress (health checks, direct API access); frontend also gets external ingress (user-facing).
- New Bicep output `AZURE_FRONTEND_URL` for the frontend's public URL.

**Key file paths**

- `azure.yaml` — `frontend` service registered alongside `backend`
- `infra/main.bicep` — `frontendContainerApp` resource (lines ~375-427)
- `frontend/Dockerfile` — envsubst templating for BACKEND_URL at startup
- `frontend/nginx.conf` — configurable `${BACKEND_URL}` + WebSocket headers

### 2026-03-14 — Fix 502 Bad Gateway on Frontend → Backend Proxy

**Root cause**

- nginx was proxying to the backend via HTTPS (`proxy_pass https://backend-fqdn`) but NOT sending TLS SNI (Server Name Indication).
- Azure Container Apps uses a shared reverse proxy within each environment. All apps in the same environment share internal IPs (100.100.x.x range). Azure's proxy uses SNI to route TLS connections to the correct container app.
- Without SNI, Azure's proxy couldn't determine which app owned the connection → reset during SSL handshake → nginx logged `peer closed connection in SSL handshake (104: Connection reset by peer)`.
- Secondary issue: `proxy_set_header Host $host` was forwarding the frontend's FQDN as the Host header to the backend. After TLS termination, Azure would use the Host header for HTTP routing — the wrong FQDN could misroute the request.

**Fix applied**

- Added `proxy_ssl_server_name on;` to nginx.conf — enables SNI so Azure can identify the target container app.
- Changed `proxy_set_header Host $host;` → `proxy_set_header Host $proxy_host;` — sends the backend's FQDN as the Host header, matching the intended destination.

**Azure Container Apps networking lesson**

- When Container App A proxies to Container App B via the external FQDN inside the same environment, the FQDN resolves to an internal IP (100.100.x.x), not the public IP. TLS is still required, and **SNI is mandatory** for Azure's shared proxy to route correctly.
- For any nginx proxy_pass to an HTTPS upstream on Azure Container Apps, always use `proxy_ssl_server_name on;`.

### 2026-03-14 — Fix 503 Error on Realtime Session Endpoint

**Root cause**

- Frontend was getting 503 errors when calling `POST /api/realtime/session`.
- Backend logs showed: `Azure OpenAI Realtime API returned 404: {"error":{"code":"404","message": "Resource not found"}}`
- The code was using the wrong Azure OpenAI Realtime API endpoint path.

**Investigation**

- Initial code used: `/openai/realtime/sessions?api-version={version}` (404)
- First fix attempt: `/openai/deployments/{deployment}/realtime/sessions?api-version={version}` (404)
- Discovered Azure OpenAI has TWO different endpoint patterns for Realtime API:
  - **Region-based endpoint** (preview): `https://{region}.realtimeapi-preview.ai.azure.com/v1/realtime/sessions` (requires Bearer token)
  - **Resource-based endpoint** (current): `https://{resource}.openai.azure.com/openai/v1/realtime/client_secrets` (requires api-key OR Bearer token)

**Correct endpoint pattern per Microsoft Learn documentation**

- URL: `{endpoint}/openai/v1/realtime/client_secrets` (no deployment in path, no api-version query param)
- Method: POST
- Body: Session configuration with nested structure:
  ```json
  {
    "session": {
      "type": "realtime",
      "model": "{deployment_name}",
      "audio": { "output": { "voice": "alloy" } },
      "instructions": "..." (optional)
    }
  }
  ```
- Response: `{ "value": "{ephemeral_token}" }` (60s TTL)

**Secondary issue discovered**

- Azure OpenAI resource had `disableLocalAuth: true` set, blocking API key authentication.
- This means the Realtime API endpoint requires **Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) Bearer tokens**, not API keys.
- Current `AzureRealtimeService` uses `api-key` header authentication.

**Fix applied**

- Updated `backend/app/services/azure/realtime.py`:
  - Changed URL from `/openai/realtime/sessions?api-version=...` to `/openai/v1/realtime/client_secrets`
  - Changed request body structure to match Azure's session configuration format
  - Changed response parsing to extract token from `data.get("value", "")`
- Committed: `ecf372d`, `65a4ea3` — "fix(voice): Correct Azure OpenAI Realtime API endpoint path"
- Deployed backend with code fix
- Testing confirmed: 404 errors fixed, now getting 403 `AuthenticationTypeDisabled` (expected)

**Outstanding issue**

- API key auth is disabled on the Azure OpenAI resource (`disableLocalAuth: true`).
- Attempted to add `disableLocalAuth: false` to `infra/main.bicep` — property didn't take effect after `azd provision`.
- **Two options documented in `.squad/decisions.md`:**
  1. **Enable API key auth** (simpler): Run `az resource update --ids "/subscriptions/.../frontdoor-6wfum6gndxawy-openai" --set properties.disableLocalAuth=false`
  2. **Switch to Entra ID tokens** (more secure): Modify `AzureRealtimeService` to use `DefaultAzureCredential` and `Authorization: Bearer {token}` header instead of `api-key: {key}`

**Key file paths**

- `backend/app/services/azure/realtime.py` — Fixed session creation endpoint (deployed)
- `infra/main.bicep` — Added `disableLocalAuth: false` property (didn't work, needs investigation)
- `.squad/decisions.md` — Documented diagnosis and two resolution options

### 2026-03-14 — Realtime Auth Fix (via Anvil)

**Resolution completed by Anvil**

- **Bicep patch** (`infra/main.bicep`): Re-enabled API key auth with `disableLocalAuth: false` (verified to take effect)
- **Service enhancement** (`backend/app/services/azure/realtime.py`): Implemented async `DefaultAzureCredential` with API key fallback, auto-token-refresh before expiration
- **Config update** (`backend/app/core/config.py`): Made `azure_openai_api_key` optional
- **Error handling**: Status-code-specific messages (401: auth failed, 403: missing role, 5xx: service down)
- **Result**: 503 errors eliminated, realtime session endpoint fully operational, 76 voice tests passing
- **Commit**: `c44b389` — "feat(voice): Re-enable API key auth, add async DefaultAzureCredential with fallback"
- **Pushed**: ✅ to main

### 2026-03-15 — Fix Voice Transcript Config (Session Config Patch)

**Problem**

- Voice feature was live but transcripts never appeared in the UI.
- Root cause #1: `input_audio_transcription` was missing from the session config sent to Azure OpenAI `/client_secrets`. Without it, the Realtime API never emits `conversation.item.input_audio_transcription.completed` events — user speech is never transcribed.
- Root cause #2: `VOICE_SYSTEM_PROMPT` was defined at module top (line 6) but never actually sent. The `create_session()` method only included `instructions` when the caller explicitly passed one, which never happened in practice.

**Fix applied**

1. **`backend/app/services/azure/realtime.py`**
   - Added `"input_audio_transcription": {"model": "whisper-1"}` to the `session_config["session"]` dict.
   - Changed conditional `if instructions: session_config["session"]["instructions"] = instructions` → `session_config["session"]["instructions"] = instructions or VOICE_SYSTEM_PROMPT`. Now the system prompt is always sent.

2. **`backend/app/services/mock/realtime.py`**
   - Imported `VOICE_SYSTEM_PROMPT` from the Azure module (single source of truth).
   - Mirrored both config additions (`input_audio_transcription` + default instructions) for API contract consistency.
   - Stored config in `self._last_session_config` for test introspection.

**Verification:** 76 voice tests passing. Import checks clean for both Azure and mock services.

**Team Coordination:** Paired with Switch's frontend `session.update` data-channel implementation (parallel spawn 2026-03-15T01:53) for belt-and-suspenders transcription enablement. Backend config change ensures system prompt and transcription are always available; frontend change adds runtime safety net.

### 2026-02-02 — California State Government Rebranding

**What was changed**

Rebranded all shared/ configuration files from 47 Doors university context to California state government services:

1. **shared/constitution.md** (v2.0.0)
   - Replaced "47 Doors Agent Constitution" → "California State AI Agent Constitution"
   - Replaced FERPA compliance → CA-specific: CCPA/CPRA, EO N-12-23 (GenAI), EO N-5-26 (AI procurement), SB 53, ADA/WCAG AA
   - Updated domain from "Higher Education Student Services" → "California State Government Services"
   - Replaced all student → constituent/resident terminology
   - Added CA-specific requirements: multilingual access (5+ languages), California Envision 2026 alignment, county coordination, emergency services integration
   - Updated examples from university scenarios (transcripts, housing) → state scenarios (benefits, permits, emergency services)
   - Added voice-specific obligations for accessibility and crisis detection
   - Updated escalation triggers: whistleblower, CPRA requests, constituent threats, discrimination

2. **shared/department_routing.json** (v2.0)
   - Replaced 6 university departments → 12 California state agencies: CDSS, DHCS, CAL FIRE, Cal OES, EDD, CDT, DMV, DGS, OPR, HCD, DCA, GovOps
   - Updated all contact info: university.edu → .ca.gov domains, state phone patterns (1-800, 1-916)
   - Changed timezone America/New_York → America/Los_Angeles
   - Updated keywords for state services: calfresh, calworks, medi-cal, wildfire, unemployment, real id, procurement, ceqa, etc.
   - Updated escalation triggers for state context: fraud report, cpra request, constituent threat, whistleblower

3. **shared/sample_queries.json** (v2.0, 50 queries)
   - Replaced ALL university queries → California constituent queries
   - Coverage: CalFresh/CalWORKs (CDSS), Medi-Cal (DHCS), wildfire/fire permits (CAL FIRE), emergency/disaster (Cal OES), unemployment/disability (EDD), DMV services, procurement (DGS), housing (HCD), consumer complaints (DCA), CEQA (OPR), AI policy (CDT)
   - Added multilingual queries: 5 Spanish queries (CalFresh, EBT, Medi-Cal, unemployment, DMV)
   - Priority distribution: 7 urgent, 13 high, 27 medium, 3 low
   - Changed schema: difficulty/is_ambiguous → priority/language for state service context

**Why**

California state government hackathon requires realistic state services context. University student support is not representative of constituent needs for benefits, emergency services, permits, and regulatory interactions. State government requires different compliance frameworks (CCPA/CPRA vs FERPA), multilingual support mandates, emergency services integration, and cross-agency coordination that don't exist in university context.

**Key differences**

- Compliance: FERPA → CCPA/CPRA, EO N-12-23, EO N-5-26, SB 53
- Urgency: Academic deadlines → life-safety emergencies (wildfire, earthquake, homelessness)
- Scale: Single institution → statewide 58-county system with 40M residents
- Languages: English-primary → multilingual mandate (Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese, Tagalog, Korean)
- Service hours: Business hours → 24/7 emergency services (Cal OES)
- Escalation: Title IX, academic probation → whistleblower, CPRA, constituent threats
